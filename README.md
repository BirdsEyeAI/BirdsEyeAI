ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jose! Welcome to my project repo!

ðŸŽ¡ Iâ€™m a Seattle based Software Engineer and Data Scientist specializing in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models.
ðŸ”Ž I love finding innovative ways to use AI to discover the hidden stories within datasets that can help businesses connect with their audiences. 
ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently working on projects that use modern RAG architecture to optimize LLM output in cloud-first environments (AWS). 
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects that leverage AI to transform industries and push the envelope of innovation.
